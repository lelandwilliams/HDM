add error classes to hdm
- enum NoErr, XmlErr, SqlErr
make hdm a singleton ?
make all sql::exec() calls through hdm, so hdm will return error value
have HDM::createconnection() return an error value,
- so that it can tell if the server is started, or if the 
	user is unkown, which means call the first-time
	wizard.
figure out if last_player_id belongs in hdm.
figure out if create_tmp_table is still needed in hdm.
- might be nice, in order to factor out code
	usable for other parsers.

have xmldownload not create files, but just pass info as streams.
add error handling to xmldownload
