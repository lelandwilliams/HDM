# Hattick Depth Manager

Imported from it's original home at hdm.sourceforge.net because
* I wanted to put all my projects in one place
* Who uses cvs anymore ?

according to sourceforge, I registered this project in 2005 !!

I was playing the online football (as in Soccer) manager game Hattrick, and wanted to write software to help me keep track of who my players were and for which positions I was training them. I had to get permission from hattrick to create the program to interact with the games data files. Since that time I'm sure the data format as well as the connection protocols have changed, not to mention to major vbersion changes in Qt, but it's fun to revisit work from so long ago.

This was my first attempt at GUI programming. I had just learned about objects and data structures
from a class I took at NEIU, and decided to put them to work. I bought a book about Qt3 and went to work.

Two things I'm particulary proud of are the custom widget to reorder the players, and the custom xmlreader I wrote in just a weekend. (For some reason I wasn't happy with any stock xml libraries).
